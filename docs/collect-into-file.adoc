= Collect outputs into a file

== Problem 

You need to concatenate into a single file all output files produced by an upstream process. 

== Solution 

Use the https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/operator.html#collectfile[collectFile] operator to merge all
the output files into a single file. 

== Code

[source,nextflow,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
process foo {
  input:
  path x
  output:
  path 'file.fq'
  script:
  """
  < $x zcat > file.fq
  """
}

workflow {
  Channel.fromPath("$baseDir/data/reads/*_1.fq.gz", checkIfExists: true) \
    | foo \
    | collectFile \
    | view
}
----

== Run it

Use the the following command to execute the example:

```
nextflow run patterns/collect-into-file.nf
```
