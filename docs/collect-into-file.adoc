= Collect outputs into a file

== Problem 

You need to concatenate into a single file all output files produced by an upstream process. 

== Solution 

Use the https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/operator.html#collectfile[collectFile] operator to merge all
the output files into a single file. 

== Code

[source,nextflow,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
Channel.fromPath('reads/*_1.fq.gz').set { samples_ch }

process foo {
  input:
  file x from samples_ch
  output:
  file 'file.fq' into unzipped_ch
  script:
  """
  < $x zcat > file.fq
  """
}

unzipped_ch
      .collectFile()
      .println{ it.text }
----

== Run it

Use the the following command to execute the example:

```
nextflow run patterns/collect-into-file.nf
```
