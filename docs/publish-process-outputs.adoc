= Store process outputs 

== Problem 

You need to store the outputs of one or more processes into a directory structure of your choice.

== Solution 

Use the https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#publishdir[publishDir] directive
to set a custom directory where the process outputs need to be made available.

== Code 

```nextflow

params.reads = 'reads/*{1,2}.fq.gz'
params.outdir = 'my-results'

Channel.fromFilePairs(params.reads).set{ samples_ch }  

process foo {
  publishDir "$params.outdir/$sampleId"
  input:
  set sampleId, file(samples) from samples_ch
  output:
  file '*.fq'

  script:
  """
  < ${samples[0]} zcat > sample_1.fq 
  < ${samples[1]} zcat > sample_2.fq 
  """
}
```

== Run it 

Run the script with the following command: 

```
nextflow run patterns/publish-process-outputs.nf 
```
