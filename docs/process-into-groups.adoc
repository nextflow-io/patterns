= Process outputs into groups 

== Problem 

You need to process in the same batch all files that have a matching key in the file name.

== Solution 

Use the https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/operator.html#map[map] operator to associate with each file
a key extracted from the file name. Then chain the resulting channel with the https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/operator.html#grouptuple[groupTuple] operator to group together all files that have a matching key. Finally use the resulting channel as input for the process.

== Code

[source,nextflow,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
Channel
    .fromPath('reads/*')  
    .map { file -> 
        def key = file.name.toString().tokenize('_').get(0)
        return tuple(key, file)
     }
    .groupTuple()
    .set{ groups_ch }


process foo {
  input:
  set key, file(samples) from groups_ch

  script:
  """
  echo your_command --batch $key --input $samples 
  """
}

== Run it 

```
nextflow run patterns/process-into-groups.nf
```
