= Mock dependency

== Problem 

You need to synchronize the execution of two processes 
for which there isn't a direct input-output relationship, 
so that process `bar` is executed only after the 
completion of process `foo`.  

== Solution

Add to the outputs of process `foo` a channel producing 
a _flag_ value. 

Then use this channel as input for process `bar` to trigger 
its execution when the other process completes.

== Code 

[source,nextflow,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
Channel
    .fromPath('.data/reads/*.fq.gz')
    .set{ reads_ch }

process foo {
    output: 
    val true into done_ch

    script:
    """
    your_command_here
    """
}

process bar {
    input: 
    val flag from done_ch
    file fq from reads_ch

    script:
    """
    other_commad_here --reads $fq
    """
}
----

== Run it

Run the example using this command:

```
nextflow run patterns/mock-dependency.nf
```
