= Channel duplication   

== Problem 

You need to you use the same channel as input in two or more processes.

== Solution

Use the https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/operator.html#into[into] operator to create two (or more) copies of the source channel. Then, use the new channels as input for the processes. 

== Code 

```nextflow

Channel
    .fromPath('prots/*_?.fa')
    .into { prot1_ch; prot2_ch }

process foo {
  input: file x from prot1_ch
  script: 
  """
    echo your_command --input $x
  """
}    

process bar {
  input: file x from prot2_ch
  script: 
  """
    your_command --input $x
  """
}    

```

== Run it

Use the the following command to execute the example:

    nextflow run patterns/channel-duplication.nf
