= Skip process execution 

== Problem 

You have two sequential tasks in your workflow. When an optional flag is specified,
the first task should be skipped and its input(s) should be processed by the second task.

== Solution

Use an empty channel, created in a conditional expression, to skip the 
first process execution when an optional parameter is specified. 

Then, define the second process input as a https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/operator.html#mix[mix] 
of the first process output (when executed) and the input channel.

== Code 

[source,nextflow,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
params.skip = false
params.input = "$baseDir/data/reads/sample.fq.gz" 

process foo {
  input:
  path x

  output:
  file('*.fastq')

  script:
  """
  < $x zcat > ${x.simpleName}.fastq
  """
}

process bar {
  debug true

  input: 
  path x

  script:
  """
  echo your_command --input $x
  """
}

workflow {
  input_ch = Channel.fromPath(params.input)

  (foo_ch, bar_ch) = params.skip
    ? [Channel.empty(), input_ch] 
    : [input_ch, Channel.empty()]

  foo_ch | foo | mix(bar_ch) | bar
}
----

== Run it

Use the the following command to execute the example:

```
nextflow run patterns/skip-process-execution.nf
```

The processes `foo` and `bar` are executed. Run the same command 
with the `--skip` command line option:

```
nextflow run patterns/skip-process-execution.nf --skip
```

This time only the `bar` process is executed.
