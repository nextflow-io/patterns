= Process per file path  

== Problem 

You need to execute a task for each file that matches a glob pattern. 

== Solution

Use the https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/channel.html#frompath[Channel.fromPath] method to create a channel emitting all files matching the glob pattern. Then, use the channel as input of the process implementing your task. 


== Code 

[source,nextflow,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
Channel.fromPath('reads/*_1.fq.gz').set{ samples_ch }

process foo {
  input:
  file x from samples_ch
  
  script:
  """
  your_command --input $x
  """
}
----


== Run it 

Use the the following command to execute the example:

    nextflow run patterns/process-per-file-path.nf
