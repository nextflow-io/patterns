= Ignore failing process 

== Problem 

A task is expected to fail in some cases. You want to ignore the failure and continue the execution of the remaining tasks in the workflow. 

== Solution

Use the process https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#errorstrategy[directive] `errorStrategy 'ignore'` to ignore the error condition. 

== Code 

[source,nextflow,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
process foo {
  errorStrategy 'ignore'
  script:
  '''
  echo This is going to fail!
  exit 1
  '''
}  

process bar {
  script:
  '''
  echo OK
  '''
}

workflow {
  foo()
  bar()
}
----

== Run it 

Run the script with the following command: 

```
nextflow run patterns/ignore-failing-process.nf 
```
