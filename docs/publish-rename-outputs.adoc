= Rename process outputs 

== Problem 

You need to save the outputs of a process to a directory, giving each file a name of your choice.

== Solution 

The https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#publishdir[publishDir] 
allows you to save the process outputs in a directory of your choice. 

Specify the `saveAs` parameter to give each file a name of your choice, providing 
a custom rule as a https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/script.html#closures[closure]. 

== Code 

[source,nextflow,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
process foo {
  publishDir 'results', saveAs: { filename -> "foo_$filename" }

  output: 
  path '*.txt'

  '''
  touch this.txt
  touch that.txt
  '''
}

workflow {
  foo()
}
----

== Run it 

```
nextflow run patterns/publish-rename-outputs.nf
```

== Save outputs in a sub-directory

The same pattern can be used to store specific files in separate directories 
depending on the actual name. 

[source,nextflow,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
process foo {
  publishDir 'results', saveAs: { filename -> filename.endsWith(".zip") ? "zips/$filename" : filename }

  output: 
  path '*'

  '''
  touch this.txt
  touch that.zip
  '''
}

workflow {
  foo()
}
----

TIP: Relative paths are resolved against the `publishDir` store path. Use an absolute path 
to store files in a directory outside the `publishDir` store path. 

== Run it 

```
nextflow run patterns/publish-rename-outputs-subdirs.nf
```
