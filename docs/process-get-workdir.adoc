= Get process work directory

== Problem 

A tool needs the explicit path of the current task work directory.

== Solution 

Use the `$PWD` Bash variable or the `pwd` command to retrieve the task working directory path. 

NOTE: Make sure to escape the `$` variable placeholder when the command script is enclosed in double quote characters.

== Example 

[source,nextflow,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
process foo {
  debug true
  script:
  """
  echo foo task path: \$PWD
  """ 
}

process bar {
  debug true
  script:
  '''
  echo bar task path: $PWD
  ''' 
}

workflow {
  foo()
  bar()
}
----

== Run it 

The command run the script with an empty channel: 

```
nextflow run patterns/process-get-workdir.nf
```

Use the following command to provide the same script
some input files, that prevents the process from being executed: 

```
nextflow run patterns/process-get-workdir.nf --inputs ../data/prots/\*
```
