= Process per file chunk  

== Problem 

You need to split one or more input files into chunks and execute a task for each of them.

== Solution

Use the https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/operator.html#splittext[splitText] operator to split a file into chunks of a given size. Then use the resulting channel as input for the process implementing your task. 

WARNING: Chunks are kept in memory by default. When splitting big files, specify the parameter `file: true` to save the chunks into files. See the https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/operator.html#splittext[documentation] for details.

Splitter for specific file formats are available, e.g. https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/operator.html#splitfasta[splitFasta] and https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/operator.html#splitfastq[splitFastq].
 
== Code 

[source,nextflow,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
params.infile = "$baseDir/data/poem.txt"
params.size = 5

process foo {
  echo true
  input: 
  file x

  script:
  """
  rev $x | rev
  """
}

workflow {
  Channel.fromPath(params.infile) \
    | splitText(by: params.size) \
    | foo
}
----

== Run it 

Use the the following command to execute the example:

```
nextflow run patterns/process-per-file-chunk.nf
```
